Optimization codes for solving the vaccine allocation (VA) problem. All algorithms can be implemented with or without budget sharing (switch "mode").

Four algorithms are available:
    * TS - solve the VA problem using a Thompson Sampling based algorithm  
    * GY - solve the VA problem using a GreedY learning algorithm   
    * MA - solve the VA problem using a Moving Average algorithm   
    * PB - solve the VA problem using a Population-Based algorithm
